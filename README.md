#MYFirstAndroidApp

This is just an Android APP I develop, for fun.

###The goals are :
* create a very simple Android APP
* use good concepts of programming (design patterns)
* define an architecture to simplify interactions between activities, model, controllers
* having fun with Github, Android Studion and Ubuntu

###As of Today, the app allows you to manage profiles :
* a profile is composed by a name, age and gender
* you can create a profile
* you can list all profiles
* more features coming soon.
