This is my first Android APP on Android Studio, on Ubuntu.
The goal is to create a simple Android APP following some good concepts of programming (MVC to isolate database access directly from the activity), learning Android development, Android Studio EDI.

As of Today, the app allows you to create a Profile (name, age) and to display all profiles.
The database is a local Mysqlite.
This app is compiled for Android 4.4 devices and superior.
