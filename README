<h1>This is my first Android APP on Android Studio, on Ubuntu.</h1>

<h2>The goals are :</h2>
* create a very simple Android APP
* use good concepts of programming (design patterns)
* define an architecture to simplify interactions between activities, model, controllers
* having fun with Github, Android Studion and Ubuntu

<h2>As of Today, the app allows you to manage profiles :</h2>
* a profile is composed by a name and an age
* you can create a profile
* you can list all profiles.

More features coming soon.
