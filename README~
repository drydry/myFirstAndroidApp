This is my first Android APP on Android Studio, on Ubuntu.

The goals are :
* create a very simple Android APP
* use good concepts of programming (design patterns)
* define an architecture to simplify interactions between activities, model, controllers
* having fun with Github, Android Studion and Ubuntu

As of Today, the app allows you to manage profiles :
* a profile is composed by a name and an age
* you can create a profile
* you can list all profiles
* more features coming soon.
